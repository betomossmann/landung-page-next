        <h2>MARIANA BARCELLOS</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my practice! My name is Mariana Barcellos and I am a
          licensed and experienced psychologist with a passion for helping
          people lead happier, healthier lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I received my degree in psychology from University of Vale dos Sinos,
          and have been practicing for 10 years. During that time, I have had
          the opportunity to work with clients from all walks of life, with a
          wide variety of needs and concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to therapy is grounded in compassion, empathy, and a deep
          respect for the unique experiences of each individual. I believe that
          everyone has the capacity to heal and grow, and my job as a therapist
          is to provide a safe and supportive environment that allows that
          process to unfold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, relationship
          issues, or just feeling stuck in life, I am here to help. I use a
          range of evidence-based techniques and interventions to help you
          overcome your challenges and achieve your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my work as a therapist, I also offer mentoring and
          coaching programs for individuals and groups who want to learn more
          about psychology and personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited to work with you and help you create the life you want. If
          you have any questions or would like to schedule an appointment,
          please don't hesitate to contact me.
        </p>

          <h3>Adults</h3>
          <p>
            In this relationship that provides support and secrecy, we will
            discover and work on symptoms that are dysfunctional for your life
            and learn to make more assertive choices. My focus is on
            collaborating so that you know yourself better and that you have a
            healthier relationship with yourself and the world around you!

          <h3>Teenagers</h3>
          <p>
            In my practice, I value the values of confidence and freedom of
            being of the adolescent. I have a specific service space so that you
            feel comfortable to open up your dilemmas and anxieties, without
            judgment. Shall we draw a more coherent route with what you want out
            of life?

          <h3>Psychologists</h3>
          <p>
            Whether through Consulting or Mentoring, I share with you all my
            experience with an office and teach you how to have a successful
            clinic! Drag the screen down and see the content I made especially
            for you!
